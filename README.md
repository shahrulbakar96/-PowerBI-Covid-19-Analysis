# (PowerBI) COVID-19 Analysis

In continuation of the recent project [(SQL - Covid Analysis)](https://github.com/shahrulbakar96/Covid-19-Analysis/blob/main/README.md), I am pleased to present the insights obtained from the chosen objectives. To enhance the presentation of these findings, I have developed a dynamic dashboard using Microsoft Power BI.

## Objectives:
While it's valuable to emphasize the positive changes that have emerged due to the pandemic, it's equally crucial to recognize the negative consequences that have also occurred. Thus, this dashboard provides the following features:
- Cumulative and daily statistics on confirmed cases, deaths, infection rates and last weekly hospitization.
- Search bar to identify cases in specific location.
- Interactive maps and charts that allow for visualization of the virus's spread across different regions.
- A time frame date to provide insights for specific day, month or year.
